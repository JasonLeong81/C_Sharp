if we could defeat the max health monster, then we sure as hell can defeat all the rest. Sort the p array.

divisibilityby2N: 1200

to be divisible by 2**n, it means divisible by 2, n times
we find how many 2 we have in our expression then see which index can give us more.
sort the index (two generator) in descending order so we can approach this problem with greedy method
