Incinerate: 1200 

if we could defeat the max health monster, then we sure as hell can defeat all the rest. Sort the p array.

divisibilityby2N: 1200

to be divisible by 2**n, it means divisible by 2, n times
we find how many 2 we have in our expression then see which index can give us more.
sort the index (two generator) in descending order so we can approach this problem with greedy method 

Scuza: 1200

max(a1,...,ai) then binary search for last occurance for highest meter that can be climbed

make it beautiiful 1783A - 800 
ugly -> not ugly 
	-- sort in desc
	-- swap first encountered ugly number with either left or right (see which is diffeerent)-> sum of all elemeents behind it = current index's value
		-- doesnt work for 1 1 1 9 
	-- put largest num in front, only situation in which this doesnt work is if both max and min of array are equals
		-- if both max and min are the same, then its no solution cuz we have cases like 1 1 1 1
